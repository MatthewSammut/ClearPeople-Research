In order to deploy the sample solution in a real environment, or at least in order to skip using the debug mode, you need to execute the following steps:

* publish the solution on any hosting environment or CDN
* Update the _cdnBasePath_ property in the write-manifests.json file with the base URL of your hosting environment

* bundle and package the solution by executing the following commands in the command line:

  * `gulp clean`
  * `gulp bundle --ship`
    gulp bundle -ship
  * `gulp package-solution --ship`
  gulp package-solution --ship

* upload the content of the ./temp/deploy subfolder of the sample root folder into the target hosting environment

* add 'spfx-discuss-now.spppkg' to the "Apps for SharePoint" library of the AppCatalog in your tenant
* the file that you will find under the ./sharepoint/solution subfolder of the sample root folder
* the sample is tenant-wide available, so you don't need to install it to every single target site, you simply need to bind the application customizer to the target site. In order to do that, you can use the PowerShell script [TenantGlobalNavBarProvisionCustomizer.ps1](./TenantGlobalNavBarProvisionCustomizer.ps1)



gulp bundle -ship
gulp package-solution --ship
gulp ci-build --ship --env=qa

gulp serve -nobrowser
